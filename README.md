Field Marshal
=============

This is just a silly little experiment in serializing a proc/lambda.  It adds a `Proc#marshal` that also dumps out all variables in Proc#binding.  It's just a "is this possible?" hack, not a properly organized piece of code.

You'll need to `$ gem install ruby2ruby ParseTree` for this to work.  Check out [example.rb](https://github.com/jbr/field_marshal/blob/master/example.rb)
